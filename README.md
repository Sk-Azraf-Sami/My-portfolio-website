## Designing a Bangla Stemmer using rule based approach

Stemming is a preprocessing task for natural language processing that involves normalizing inflected words representing the same concept of the original word. Steaming is a process of text normalization that has many applications. There are many techniques for steaming of inflected words for different languages but very few works for Bangla word steaming. Therefore, stemming Bangla word is a unsolved problem. There are many different situations that can occur in Bangla language for word steaming. In this paper, we present a rule based algorithm to stem Bangla words. We developed the rules for infection detection for verb inflection, number inflection, and others. Using our rules, we developed a system to find the root word of Bangla words and found good performance. Sufficient examples are provided to explain the proposed system.

## Gold Dataset for the Evaluation of Bangla Stemmer

Stemming is a preprocessing task for Natural Language Processing(NLP) that involves normalizing inflected words representing the same concept of the original word. Steaming is a process of text normalization that transforms a slated word into its root form. It has a great impact in different applications in NLP and Natural Language Understanding. One of the biggest challenges in Bangla stemming is to collect the rules that are associated with Bangla word stemming and standard dataset for testing the accuracy. This paper presents a summery of rules associated with Bangla stemming and a gold standard dataset corpus which will helps to testify the stemming algorithm. We verify the rules and using our rules and corpus we tested with existing Bangla stemming algorithms and found that the proposed corpus makes a difference with existing techniques.
